# CrewAI_Project
Using multiple AI agents to create a crew that tailors your resume to a specific job description. One agent researches the job, two others tailor the profile, and the last creates interview preparation material.  

Overview
In this project, a team of specialized AI agents collaborates to help job seekers optimize their applications. Each agent has a defined role and goal:
Researcher – Extracts job requirements from postings.
Profiler – Builds a comprehensive profile from personal write-ups and GitHub projects.
Resume Strategist – Tailors resumes to align with job requirements.
Interview Preparer – Generates interview questions and talking points based on the tailored resume.
By leveraging multiple agents, this system demonstrates how AI can break down complex tasks and efficiently coordinate across specialized roles.
